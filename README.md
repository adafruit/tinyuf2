## Features

Supported features are

- Double tap to enter DFU, reboot to DFU and quick reboot from application
- DFU with MassStorage (MSC)
- Self update with uf2 file
- Indicator: LED, RGB, TFT
- Debug log with uart/swd

Not all features are implemented for all MCUs, following is supported MCUs and its feature

## Build and Flash

Following is generic compiling information. Each port may require extra set-up and slight different process e.g esp32s2 require setup IDF.

### Clone

Clone this repo with its submodule

```
$ git clone git@github.com:adafruit/tinyuf2.git tinyuf2
$ cd tinyuf2
$ git submodule update --init
```

### Compile

To build this for a specific board, we need to change current directory to its port folder

```
$ cd ports/stm32f4
```

Firstly we need to get all submodule dependency for our board using `tools/get_deps.py` script with either family input or using --board option. You only need to do this once for each family

```
python tools/get_deps.py stm32f4
python tools/get_deps.py --board feather_stm32f405_express
```

Then compile with `all` target:

```
make BOARD=feather_stm32f405_express all
```

### Flash

`flash` target will use the default on-board debugger (jlink/cmsisdap/stlink/dfu) to flash the binary, please install those support software in advance. Some board use bootloader/DFU via serial which is required to pass to make command

```
$ make BOARD=feather_stm32f405_express flash
```

If you use an external debugger, there is `flash-jlink`, `flash-stlink`, `flash-pyocd` which are mostly like to work out of the box for most of the supported board.

### Debug

To compile for debugging add `DEBUG=1`, this will mostly change the compiler optimization

```
$ make BOARD=feather_stm32f405_express DEBUG=1 all
```

#### Log

Should you have an issue running example and/or submitting an bug report. You could enable TinyUSB built-in debug logging with optional `LOG=`.
- **LOG=1** will print message from bootloader and error if any from TinyUSB stack.
- **LOG=2** and **LOG=3** will print more information with TinyUSB stack events

```
$ make BOARD=feather_stm32f405_express LOG=1 all
```

#### Logger

By default log message is printed via on-board UART which is slow and take lots of CPU time comparing to USB speed. If your board support on-board/external debugger, it would be more efficient to use it for logging. There are 2 protocols:

- `LOGGER=rtt`: use [Segger RTT protocol](https://www.segger.com/products/debug-probes/j-link/technology/about-real-time-transfer/)
  - Cons: requires jlink as the debugger.
  - Pros: work with most if not all MCUs
  - Software viewer is JLink RTT Viewer/Client/Logger which is bundled with JLink driver package.

```
$ make BOARD=feather_stm32f405_express LOG=2 LOGGER=rtt all
```
